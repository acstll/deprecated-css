# DEPRECATED CSS

What I use for writing CSS. Ever heard of [Basscss](https://basscss.com), [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)?

The name is a joke. Because CSS-in-JS has come to save us.

## Install

```bash
npm i acstll/deprecated-css
```

## Usage

I'm working on thisâ€¦

## TODO

- [x] cli
  - [ ] depre make <module-name> (to scaffold new module - template)
  - [ ] depre copy <file> (to copy single modules)
- [ ] setup some testing (postcss directly to compile, just test for no errors)
- [ ] document styles and a bit of tooling

## Debate

- `measure-none` instead of `max-w-none`
